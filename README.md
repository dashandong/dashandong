I am a Associate Research Fellow in Optics at Peking University, advised by Prof. Kebin Shi. My research is primarily focused on developing advanced label-free microscope for biomedical imaging. My projects have been related to modeling light propagation/scattering in theory, modulating light field in experiments, and computational imaging of live cells in application. Moreover, my work is also related with ultrafast optics and spectroscopy.
